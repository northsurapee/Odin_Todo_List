## Design
- I seperate functionality in to 5 modules
    - task : logic of task
    - project : logic of project
    - project container : logic of project container
    - UI : DOM manipulation
    - index

## Note to self
- on smaller screen, side panel show above instead of on the side(flex items vs position absolute);
